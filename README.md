# Pinia persisted state for Nuxt 2
This is a fork of the [original plugin](https://github.com/prazdevs/pinia-plugin-persistedstate) with minor changes that allow the plugin to work with Nuxt 2. The plugin's API has not changed.

The original plugin does not work with Nuxt 2 due to client hydration conflicts, you can explore my commits for more information.
